# YATM-ish (Yet Another Tiling Manager-ish)
A very rough imitation of "Snap-Layout" feature (-of Windows) in Linux (as a tiling manager)

To Setup and run-
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karvy-Singh/YATM-ish.git
cd YATM-ish
```
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
chmod +x run.sh
#to be done only for the initial setup
```
```bash
./run.sh        # use it everytime to trigger the TM
```
